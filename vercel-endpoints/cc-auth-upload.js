// Miles Man CRM — public Credit Card Authorization Form upload.
//
// WHERE THIS GOES: copy to api/cc-auth-upload.js in the milesman-auth Vercel
// project (C:\Users\ericl\milesman-auth-fix), then `vercel --prod`. Not part
// of the milesman-crm repo's own deploy (GitHub Pages, static files only,
// no secret storage) — the public page that POSTs here is cc-auth-upload.html
// in this repo.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES: a client opens a personalized link (generated from their
// CRM record — index.html's "Copy Upload Link" button on the client form,
// §4.12 in DOCUMENTATION.md) and uploads their completed, signed credit card
// authorization PDF. There's no login for the client — this endpoint is
// public the same way the Book a Trip form and the Jetpack subscribe
// endpoint are, and treats every request as untrusted input to validate,
// not as an authenticated call. The PDF is uploaded server-side straight
// into a private Google Drive folder using the SAME server-held Drive
// credential api/secure-sync.js already established — the browser (client
// or CRM) never holds a credential capable of reading Drive, only of
// POSTing a new file to this one endpoint.
//
// REQUIRED VERCEL ENV VARS (both already set for api/secure-sync.js):
//   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET      — same OAuth 2.0 Client Secret Drive
//                               Backup/Restore and Secure Sync use
//   DRIVE_SERVER_REFRESH_TOKEN — a real refresh token for the account that
//                               should own the uploaded files (Debug Panel's
//                               "Copy Drive Refresh Token" button in the CRM,
//                               same value Secure Sync setup already used)
// No new env vars needed if Secure Sync (§4.1a) is already configured.
//
// ALSO SENDS AN EMAIL NOTIFICATION to eric@themilesman.com on every
// successful upload, via Microsoft Graph's /me/sendMail — same Outlook
// connection (MS_CLIENT_ID/MS_TENANT_ID, Mail.Send scope) the CRM's own
// "Connect Outlook" flow already consents to, but using a stored SERVER
// refresh token so this unattended endpoint can send without a live browser
// session open. Requires one more env var:
//   MS_SERVER_REFRESH_TOKEN — a refresh token for the Outlook account that
//                               should send/receive these notifications.
//                               Same value api/daily-analytics-email.js
//                               already uses if that's set up (copy
//                               localStorage's mm_ms_refresh from the CRM
//                               after connecting Outlook there — Debug
//                               Panel has no copy button for this one yet,
//                               so pull it from devtools: localStorage
//                               .getItem('mm_ms_refresh')). The CRM's
//                               MS_SCOPE must include Mail.Send (it does as
//                               of the comment at its definition) — an
//                               existing mm_ms_refresh captured before that
//                               scope was added won't carry it retroactively,
//                               so reconnect Outlook once in the CRM first if
//                               this 403s with an insufficient-scope error.
// If MS_SERVER_REFRESH_TOKEN isn't set, or the send otherwise fails, the
// upload itself still succeeds — the file reaching Drive is the actual
// deliverable here, so an email outage is logged (visible in Vercel's
// function logs) and surfaced back in the response as emailSent:false,
// rather than failing the client's upload over a notification side-effect.
//
// WHETHER UPLOADS SHOW UP IN THE CRM'S OWN "Browse Google Drive" PICKER IS
// GENUINELY UNCERTAIN — treat this with real caution, not optimism. A live
// test against a real account already confirmed drive.file scope is
// stricter than hoped: this server-side credential could NOT see a "Miles
// Man" folder the account owner created by hand in the Drive website (see
// getUploadFolderId()'s comment below) — only folders it created itself
// were visible to it. Whether the CRM's own separate browser-side
// drive.file token (same OAuth Client ID, same account, but a DIFFERENT
// authorization grant) can see folders THIS credential created is a
// different question that hasn't been tested either way. If a client's
// uploaded PDF doesn't turn up in the CRM's Drive picker, that's not
// necessarily a failed upload — check the Google Drive web UI directly
// (drive.google.com, under whichever account owns DRIVE_SERVER_REFRESH_TOKEN,
// search "Credit Card Authorization Forms") before assuming anything went
// wrong; the file is very likely there regardless of what the picker shows.
//
// FILE SIZE: capped at 8MB (MAX_BYTES below), matching cc-auth-upload.html's
// own client-side cap — keep the two in sync if this is ever changed.
// This is deliberately conservative, NOT a confirmed Vercel platform limit:
// standard Node.js Serverless Functions have historically capped request
// bodies well under 8MB on some plans, so if uploads fail with a 413 here,
// lower MAX_BYTES in both files, or move this endpoint to an Edge Function
// (different body-size rules) — verify against whatever the account's
// actual Vercel plan documents before raising it.
//
// SECURITY NOTE: this endpoint is intentionally public and unauthenticated,
// same trust model as the Book a Trip form (§4.4) — anyone with a link can
// upload a PDF, but the link grants no read access to anything, and every
// upload is validated server-side (real PDF magic bytes, not just the
// client-side .pdf check, which a malicious caller could bypass entirely)
// before it's written to Drive. There is no rate limiting — a determined
// abuser could still spam small PDFs at this endpoint; that's an accepted
// gap for a low-traffic single-client-facing form, not something this file
// defends against.

// means this server credential cannot see a "Miles Man" folder the account
// owner created by hand in the Drive website — only folders THIS credential
// itself created are visible to it, no matter the folder name or location.
// A naive "find Miles Man under root, then find/create Credit Card
// Authorization Forms under that" (the original approach) therefore never
// finds the real, hand-created Miles Man folder and creates a brand new,
// separate one on every cold start — Drive allows duplicate folder names,
// so this silently produces a fresh "Miles Man" duplicate (shown in Drive's
// own UI with a "(1)"/"(2)" disambiguation suffix) instead of erroring.
//
// The fix: check for an existing "Credit Card Authorization Forms" folder
// by name FIRST, with no parent constraint (findFolderAnywhere above) —
// this finds it wherever it currently lives, including after being moved.
// Combined with a ONE-TIME manual step (move the folder this credential
// created into the account's real "Miles Man" folder, then delete the
// leftover empty duplicate), every future request finds that exact same
// folder by its Drive file ID and reuses it — moving a file never changes
// its ID or this credential's access to it, only which folder currently
// contains it. Only on a true first run (no Credit Card Authorization
// Forms folder exists anywhere this credential can see) does this fall
